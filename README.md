PROJECT:INVENTORY MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD

Creating an Inventory Management Dashboard in Power BI involves tracking key metrics to manage stock levels, optimize inventory, and enhance supply chain efficiency. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a comprehensive dashboard:

1. Data Preparation
Inventory Data: Import data related to your inventory. This might include:
Item names or SKUs
Purchase date
Stock level
Reorder levels
Supplier details
Sales data
Warehouse locations
Stock Movements: Track changes in stock, including sales, returns, and transfers.
Time Periods: Have a date column to track stock levels over time.
Common Data Sources: Excel, SQL databases, SharePoint, or APIs from inventory management software (like SAP, QuickBooks).

2. Metrics and KPIs
Key performance indicators (KPIs) for an inventory management dashboard include:

Total Stock on Hand: The total available stock of all items.
Reorder Points: Items that are nearing or have reached reorder levels.
Days of Inventory (DOI): The average number of days inventory is expected to last.
Stockout Rate: The percentage of items that have gone out of stock.
Inventory Turnover Ratio: How often inventory is sold or replaced over a period.
Aging Inventory: Items that have been in stock for a long time.
Value of Inventory: The total value of your inventory based on unit cost.
Supplier Lead Times: Track the time it takes for suppliers to fulfill orders.
3. Data Modeling in Power BI
Load the data into Power BI by importing files or connecting to databases.
Create relationships between different tables (e.g., Sales, Inventory, Suppliers).
Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations like running totals, reorder levels, or aging analysis.
4. Dashboard Visualizations
Below are some essential visualizations that you can use:

A. KPIs
Add a KPI card for each important metric like Total Stock on Hand, Reorder Point Items, and Stock Value.
B. Inventory Trends
Line Chart: Visualize stock levels over time.
Area Chart: Track stock levels of different categories or warehouses.
Bar Chart: Compare stock levels of different products or product categories.
C. Inventory Turnover
Gauge Chart: Display inventory turnover ratios.
Bar Chart: Show the number of inventory turns for each product.
D. Reorder Alerts
Conditional Formatting: Highlight products that are below the reorder point in a table or matrix visualization.
Stacked Column Chart: Visualize how many items are near or below reorder points.
E. Stock Aging
Pie Chart or TreeMap: Show aging inventory by categorizing it into age groups (e.g., 0–30 days, 31–60 days, etc.).
F. Supplier Performance
Bar or Line Chart: Track supplier lead times and display the average time it takes to receive goods.
5. Interactivity
Slicers: Allow users to filter data by product category, warehouse, or time periods.
Drill-Through: Set up drill-through pages where users can click on a product or supplier to see more details.
6. Automation and Alerts
Set up Power BI Alerts for specific thresholds (e.g., when stock goes below a certain level or inventory value changes).
Use Power Automate for automatic emails or notifications when certain conditions are met.
Example Layout of the Dashboard:
Top Section: KPIs (Total Stock, Stock Value, Stock Turnover).
Left Panel: Slicers (Product Category, Warehouse, Date).
Center Section: Stock levels over time (Line chart or Bar chart).
Right Panel: Reorder alerts and stockout warnings.
Bottom Section: Aging inventory, supplier performance, and item-wise details.
